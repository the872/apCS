//Your Tasks:
/*
0 - Change the code so that the randomly generated numbers represent a DICE roll, not a COIN flip

1 - Add code so that two different dice are rolled at the same time 
    You'll need a new variable, you'll need to change its value, and you'll need to draw it

2 - Add code so that bigger of the two rolled dice is displayed (I wish there was a Math function for thisâ€¦)
    You'll need a new variable, you'll have to change its value when a roll is finished, and you'll need to draw it

3 - Add code so that the sum of the two rolled dice is displayed
    You'll need a new variable, you'll need to change its value, and you'll need to draw it

4 - Add code so that you keep a running total of the finished dice rolls
	For example: 	You roll a 5 and a 6, the running total is now 11
			You roll a 3 and a 2, the running total is now 16
			You roll a 1 and a 1, the running total is now 18
    You'll need a new variable, you'll have to change its value when a roll is finished, and you'll need to draw it
